### SSS Resource Registry Methodology Working Group

The SSS Resource Registry Methodology Working Group is a collaborative expert panel convened by the Granular Registry to develop, refine, and oversee standardized approaches for identifying, allocating, and reporting Standard Supply Service (SSS) resources in compliance with evolving GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance. Comprising representatives from utilities, regulatory bodies, third-party verifiers, corporate reporters, and clean energy advocacy organizations, the Working Group ensures methodologies are transparent, auditable, and adaptable to diverse energy markets globally. Its primary objectives include preventing resource shuffling of legacy clean energy assets, aligning SSS claims with traceable financial relationships, and facilitating accurate market-based Scope 2 emissions accounting—whether on an annual or hourly basis. The Working Group operates through two parallel tracks: a public methodology for broad accessibility and a supplier-verified methodology for enhanced precision and assurance. Both tracks prioritize Scope 2 Quality Criteria (e.g., exclusive ownership, no double counting, deliverability) and integrate public data sources like utility filings, certificate registries, and grid mix disclosures.

#### Track 1: Public Methodology
This track focuses on generating accessible, proxy-based SSS reports using the best available public data, enabling reporters to claim pro-rata shares of SSS clean energy even when direct supplier allocation is unavailable. It serves as a credible third-party fallback, as referenced in GHG Protocol drafts, by aggregating and analyzing publicly disclosed information to estimate SSS-eligible resources (e.g., regulated cost recovery assets, non-bypassable charges for RPS/CES compliance, and taxpayer-funded public ownership). Key steps include:

- **Data Inventory and Sourcing**: Compile region-specific datasets from authoritative public sources, such as EIA Form 861 (U.S. retail sales), state RPS compliance reports, Eurostat electricity mixes (EU), or ENTSO-E production data. For zero-carbon attributes, cross-reference certificate-tracking systems (e.g., PJM GATS, AIB GO cancellations) and plant-level registries (e.g., EPA eGRID for nuclear/hydro ownership).
  
- **SSS Designation and Allocation**: Apply decision trees to classify resources as SSS (e.g., monopoly-supplied hydro/nuclear, compliance RECs retired for default service). Calculate pro-rata entitlements using formulas like: Claimable SSS MWh = (SSS Clean MWh / Total Retail Sales MWh) × Customer Load MWh. For emission factors, derive supplier-specific rates (SSEFs) by subtracting SSS clean volumes from grid/residual mixes and applying fuel-specific CO₂ intensities.

- **Report Generation and Disclosure**: Produce annual (and, where feasible, hourly-proxy) SSS reports per utility/market, including breakdowns by technology (e.g., hydro, nuclear, renewables) and confidence scores for data quality. Reports are published openly on the Granular Registry platform, with versioned documentation (e.g., Jupyter notebooks) for reproducibility. Limitations, such as annual granularity potentially under-allocating in scarcity hours, are explicitly noted.

This methodology enhances feasibility for reporters in data-scarce regions, promotes transparency, and avoids over-reliance on supplier cooperation, while encouraging utilities to provide better data to supersede proxies.

#### Track 2: Supplier-Verified Methodology
This track establishes rigorous protocols for evaluating and auditing supplier-submitted data to generate verified SSS reports, which suppliers can then share directly with their customers for precise Scope 2 claims. It emphasizes supplier-led allocation as the preferred approach, reducing double-counting risks and aligning with traceable financial relationships (e.g., non-bypassable charges). The process includes:

- **Data Submission and Assessment**: Suppliers submit structured datasets (e.g., hourly generation/load profiles, REC retirements, fuel mixes) via the Granular Registry's secure portal. The Working Group defines validation criteria, such as attestation of EAC ownership, compliance with SSS categories (regulated recovery, non-bypassable charges, public funding), and exclusion of voluntary products (e.g., green tariffs). Multi-angle verification involves cross-checking against public benchmarks (e.g., EEI emissions data, AIB residual mixes) and flagging discrepancies.

- **Audit and Certification**: Independent third-party auditors, accredited by the Working Group, conduct reviews using standardized checklists (e.g., confirming no external REC sales from SSS resources, temporal matching for hourly claims). Audits incorporate mathematical validations (e.g., load-ratio share calculations) and logic frameworks to challenge assumptions, such as export/import adjustments. Verified reports include audited SSEFs, pro-rata SSS clean MWh allocations, and optional hourly extensions (e.g., time-stamped certificates for 24/7 matching).

- **Sharing and Integration**: Audited reports are distributed to supplier customers upon request, with opt-in features for automated Scope 2 integration (e.g., via API). Suppliers may charge administrative fees for granular data, but the methodology mandates transparency on exclusions (e.g., cross-border public assets not qualifying as SSS). Uncertainties, like potential subsidy interactions, are documented, and reports are stamped with audit trails for stakeholder scrutiny.

By distinguishing verified data from public proxies, this track incentivizes supplier participation, minimizes estimation errors, and supports advanced claims while maintaining alignment with GHG Protocol principles. The Working Group reviews both tracks annually, incorporating feedback from pilots (e.g., Entergy Arkansas Go Zero Tariff) and policy updates to ensure robustness across markets.

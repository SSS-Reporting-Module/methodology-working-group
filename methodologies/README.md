# methodologies

Start here: `sss-methodology.md` — unified SSS methodology (verified-first with public-data fallbacks) defining one data schema, common calculations, and outputs.

Annexes:
- `calculating-verified-sss-with-utility-data.md` — utility-data verification details (vintage banking, retirement deadlines, attestation checks).
- `estimating-sss-from-public-sources.md` — public-data ETL fallback cookbook and examples.

Playbook:
- `global-public-data-assessment/` — step-by-step ETL instructions to populate the unified schema field-by-field when utility submissions are unavailable.

Regions:
- `us/` — supplier/region-specific notes (banking rules, disclosure quirks) that inform the unified methodology.
